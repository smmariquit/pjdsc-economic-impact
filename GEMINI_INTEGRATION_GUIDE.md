# Live Forecast & Gemini Integration Update

## Summary of Changes

### 1. **Live Forecast Mechanism**
The "Obtain Live Forecast" button works by checking two locations:

1. **Primary**: `model/Final_Transform/forecasts/live_forecast.txt`
   - If this file exists, it loads the bulletin from here
   - This is for ACTUAL live storms currently active

2. **Fallback**: `storm_list.json` â†’ `recent_storms[0]`
   - If no live_forecast.txt exists, it automatically loads the MOST RECENT storm from the list
   - This is currently **Tropical Storm Nando (Nov 13, 2024)**

**Location in code**: Lines 850-893 in `app_ml.py`

### 2. **Typhoon Nando Added** âœ…
Created a new storm bulletin for **Typhoon Nando (Ragasa)**:
- **File**: `model/Final_Transform/forecasts/nando_2024.txt`
- **Formed**: September 17, 2025
- **Dissipated**: September 25, 2025
- **Peak Intensity**: 85kt typhoon (Category 2 equivalent)
- **Impact**: Landfall in Aurora/Isabela, Northeastern Luzon
- **Details**: 
  - Storm surge: 2.5-3.5 meters (Baler Bay area)
  - Rainfall: 300-500mm over 72 hours
  - Wind speeds: 130-160 km/h at landfall
  - High risk: Aurora, Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Cagayan Valley
  - Agricultural impact: 50,000+ hectares of rice and corn cropland affected
  - Major river flooding expected on Cagayan River

**Wikipedia Reference**: [Typhoon Ragasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Ragasa)

**Registered in**: `storm_list.json` (added as first entry, so it's the "latest" storm)

### 3. **Gemini AI Integration** âœ…

#### Installed Packages:
- `python-dotenv` - For loading .env file
- `google-generativeai` - Gemini API client

#### New Function: `generate_lgu_insights()`
**Location**: Lines 216-290 in `app_ml.py`

**What it does**:
- Takes ML prediction results (affected people, damaged houses, economic cost)
- Sends data to Gemini Pro AI model
- Generates **specific, actionable LGU recommendations** in 4 categories:
  1. **Pre-Impact Preparations** (Next 24-48 hours)
  2. **Response Operations** (During Impact)
  3. **Post-Impact Recovery** (First 72 hours)
  4. **Resource Requirements**

**Input data sent to Gemini**:
- Storm name and year
- Total affected people, houses, economic cost
- Top 5 most affected provinces
- If user selected a province: detailed data for that specific province

#### UI Changes:
**Location**: Lines 395-417 in `app_ml.py`

Added new section after prediction summary:
- **Title**: "ðŸ¤– AI-Generated LGU Action Plan"
- **Spinner**: Shows "ðŸ§  Generating disaster management recommendations using Gemini AI..." while processing
- **Display**: Shows AI-generated markdown text with recommendations
- **Download Button**: "ðŸ“¥ Download LGU Action Plan" - saves recommendations as .txt file
- **Error Handling**: If Gemini API fails, shows warning about checking API key

### 4. **API Key Configuration**
The system reads the Gemini API key from `.env` file:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyCWn8G0zvoTik5Dc5MvEZ9SvDLHl7Gex8s
```

**Security Note**: This key is loaded using `python-dotenv` and passed to `genai.configure()`

## How It Works End-to-End

1. User clicks **"ðŸ“¡ Obtain Live Forecast"** button
2. System loads Typhoon Nando (Sep 21, 2025 - latest storm in list)
3. ML model predicts impacts across all 83 provinces
4. Results displayed with metrics and charts
5. **NEW**: Gemini AI analyzes the predictions
6. **NEW**: LGU Action Plan generated with specific recommendations
7. User can download the action plan for offline use

## Testing the System

To test the complete flow:

1. Run the app: `streamlit run app_ml.py`
2. Select your province (e.g., Aurora or Isabela - high risk for Nando/Ragasa)
3. Click **"ðŸ“¡ Obtain Live Forecast"**
4. Wait for ML prediction to complete
5. Scroll down to see **"ðŸ¤– AI-Generated LGU Action Plan"**
6. Review the Gemini-generated recommendations
7. Click **"ðŸ“¥ Download LGU Action Plan"** to save

## Files Modified

1. `app_ml.py` - Main application (+105 lines)
   - Added imports for dotenv and google.generativeai
   - Added `generate_lgu_insights()` function
   - Added LGU insights display section

2. `model/Final_Transform/forecasts/nando_2024.txt` - NEW storm bulletin

3. `model/Final_Transform/forecasts/storm_list.json` - Added Nando entry

4. `.env` - Contains Gemini API key (already existed)

## Expected Gemini Output Format

The AI generates recommendations like:

```markdown
### 1. Pre-Impact Preparations (Next 24-48 hours)
- Evacuate coastal barangays in Cagayan within 2-3m storm surge zone
- Preposition 50,000 family food packs in Tuguegarao warehouse
- Activate Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction offices in all affected LGUs

### 2. Response Operations (During Impact)
- Deploy search and rescue teams to priority areas
- Establish emergency shelters with 48-hour supplies
- Maintain communication with isolated communities

### 3. Post-Impact Recovery (First 72 hours)
- Conduct rapid damage assessment within 6 hours
- Clear primary roads for relief access
- Restore power to critical facilities

### 4. Resource Requirements
- 200 rescue personnel
- 50,000 food packs
- Emergency medical supplies
- Heavy equipment for debris clearing
```

## Technical Notes

- **API Model**: `gemini-pro` (text generation)
- **Timeout**: None set (relies on default)
- **Rate Limits**: Google's free tier limits apply
- **Cost**: Free tier includes 60 requests/minute
- **Fallback**: If API fails, shows warning but doesn't crash app

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Cache Gemini responses to reduce API calls
2. Add province-specific recommendations based on geography
3. Include historical storm comparisons
4. Generate evacuation route maps
5. Estimate timeline for specific actions

REMARKS:
231200Z POSITION NEAR 11.5N 129.0E.
23OCT25. TYPHOON 31W (MARIA), LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 220 NM 
EAST-SOUTHEAST OF DAVAO, PHILIPPINES, HAS TRACKED 
WESTWARD AT 18 KNOTS OVER THE PAST SIX HOURS. ANIMATED 
ENHANCED INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT MARIA IS A 
WELL-ORGANIZED SYSTEM WITH A DEFINED EYE FEATURE AND 
INTENSE DEEP CONVECTION WRAPPING INTO THE CENTER. 
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WITH LOW VERTICAL WIND 
SHEAR AND WARM SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE SUPPORTING 
CONTINUED INTENSIFICATION. MARIA IS FORECAST TO REACH 
PEAK INTENSITY OF 105 KT WITHIN 24 HOURS BEFORE MAKING 
LANDFALL OVER SOUTHERN LEYTE, PHILIPPINES. AFTER LANDFALL, 
INTERACTION WITH THE RUGGED TERRAIN OF THE VISAYAS AND 
LAND FRICTION WILL CAUSE RAPID WEAKENING AS THE SYSTEM 
TRACKS WEST-NORTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE CENTRAL PHILIPPINES 
TOWARDS PALAWAN. SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ARE EXPECTED INCLUDING 
DESTRUCTIVE WINDS, STORM SURGE, AND EXTREME RAINFALL 
LEADING TO FLASH FLOODING AND LANDSLIDES ACROSS MINDANAO, 
VISAYAS, AND SOUTHERN LUZON. MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE AT 
231200Z IS 960 MB. MAXIMUM SIGNIFICANT WAVE HEIGHT AT 
231200Z IS 35 FEET.//
